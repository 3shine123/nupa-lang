#!/bin/bash
# run_multi_tu.sh — cross-TU link consistency suite.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# Nupa's uniform vtable is built per translation unit from the set of instance
# methods that TU happens to see. Two TUs that see DIFFERENT method sets compile
# two different `struct nupa_vtable` layouts, while the linker weak-merges the
# vtable *instances* into a single allocation. Dispatch through the losing
# layout then reads the wrong slot: silent garbage or a segfault at whatever
# offset the miscalculation lands on. Plain C never hits this because every
# struct definition is spelled out in the source; Nupa synthesises the layout,
# so C's type system cannot protect us.
#
# This suite pins down, per language feature, whether it survives a cross-TU
# link. A feature that cannot is recorded here as an explicit, loud failure —
# not as a mystery crash three weeks later.
#
# Each case is a directory containing:
#   *.nh   declarations shared by both TUs (the only channel between them)
#   lib.np the "library" TU: defines the classes, exposes entry points
#   main.np the "client" TU: sees only the .nh, drives the classes
#   expected.txt  the stdout the program must print (optional; absent = no
#                 output assertion, only "it must run and exit 0")
#
# Usage:  ./run_multi_tu.sh            run everything
#         ./run_multi_tu.sh 05_block   run one case (by dir name or number)
#   NPAC=path/to/nupac ./run_multi_tu.sh
